## 1. Introduction
In today's interconnected world, organizations and individuals face numerous cyber security risks. These risks pose a threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and computer systems. This readme document provides an overview of common cyber security risks and suggests best practices for mitigating those risks.

## 2. Common Cyber Security Risks

### Malware
Malware refers to malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access or cause damage to computer systems. It includes viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, and other malicious programs. Malware can be delivered through email attachments, infected websites, or removable media.

### Phishing
Phishing is a technique used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details. Phishing attacks often involve emails or websites that appear legitimate, but are designed to deceive users.

### Social Engineering
Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals to gain unauthorized access to confidential information or computer systems. It involves psychological manipulation rather than technical exploits. Examples include impersonating someone in a position of authority, tricking users into revealing passwords, or gaining physical access to restricted areas.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the availability of computer systems or networks by overwhelming them with a flood of illegitimate requests. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the targeted resource.

### Password Attacks
Password attacks involve attempts to obtain or crack passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. Common techniques include brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, an attacker intercepts and relays communications between two parties without their knowledge. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop, modify, or inject malicious content into the communication.

### SQL Injection
SQL injection is a web application vulnerability where an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into an application's database query. This can result in unauthorized access, data manipulation, or data leakage.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. These scripts can be used to steal sensitive information, manipulate website content, or launch further attacks.

### Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files or locks computer systems, rendering them inaccessible to the victim. Attackers demand a ransom in exchange for restoring access. Ransomware is typically delivered through email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software.

### Insider Threats
Insider threats refer to risks posed by individuals within an organization who misuse their privileges or access to compromise security.
