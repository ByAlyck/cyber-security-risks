4. than technical exploits. Examples include impersonating someone in a position of authority, tricking users into revealing passwords, or gaining physical access to restricted areas.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to disrupt the availability of computer systems or networks by overwhelming them with a flood of illegitimate requests. This prevents legitimate users from accessing the targeted resource.

### Password Attacks
Password attacks involve attempts to obtain or crack passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems or accounts. Common techniques include brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
In a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, an attacker intercepts and relays communications between two parties without their knowledge. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop, modify, or inject malicious content into the communication.

### SQL Injection
SQL injection is a web application vulnerability where an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into an application's database query. This can result in unauthorized access, data manipulation, or data leakage.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. These scripts can be used to steal sensitive information, manipulate website content, or launch further attacks.

### Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files or locks computer systems, rendering them inaccessible to the victim. Attackers demand a ransom in exchange for restoring access. Ransomware is typically delivered through email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software.

### Insider Threats
Insider threats refer to risks posed by individuals within an organization who misuse their privileges or access to compromise security.
